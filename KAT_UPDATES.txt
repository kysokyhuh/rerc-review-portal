KAT UPDATE NOTES - December 29, 2025

What this project is
- RERC System = RA dashboard + API for managing research ethics review submissions.
- Backend: Node/Express + Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL (port 3000).
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite (port 5173).
- Shared package: common types/constants used by both.

Quick orientation to folders
- backend/: API (Express), Prisma schema/migrations, tests.
- frontend/: React app (src) and built assets (dist/).
- packages/shared/: shared TS types/constants.
- samples/: example CSVs for letters.
- FILE_EXPLANATIONS.txt: full file-by-file map with purposes (updated).

Setup and run (happy path)
- Prereqs: Node/npm, PostgreSQL running locally.
- Env: copy .env.example to .env (root), adjust DB URL; backend/.env also exists locally.
- Backend: cd backend && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
- Frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev # http://localhost:5173
- Visit http://localhost:5173 to use the app.

Current state of repo
- Latest push on main: commit 30b69bc “Update FILE_EXPLANATIONS to list all files.”
- FILE_EXPLANATIONS.txt now documents every file (locks, generated Prisma files, dist assets, env samples).
- Local-only: docs/SECURITY.md and docs/fixes.md are deleted but not committed/pushed—decide to restore or commit removal before next push.

What to read first
- README.md for setup basics.
- FILE_EXPLANATIONS.txt for a guided map of all files (backend, frontend, prisma, generated, dist).

What needs a decision/action
- Choose: keep or remove docs/SECURITY.md and docs/fixes.md. If keeping, restore; if removing, commit and push.
- If you regenerate Prisma or rebuild frontend, update FILE_EXPLANATIONS.txt again to stay in sync.

Reminders
- Keep .env and backend/.env out of git.
- Samples live in samples/ (initial_ack.csv, initial_approval.csv).
- DB schema and migrations in backend/prisma/; ERD diagrams there too.

Local-only items (not pushed)
- docs/SECURITY.md and docs/fixes.md are deleted locally but not committed or pushed. Decide whether to restore them or commit the deletions before the next push.

Where things are
- Branch: main (tracking origin/main).
- Key references: README.md for setup; FILE_EXPLANATIONS.txt for the full file map; samples/ for test CSVs.
- Envs: .env at root and backend/.env exist locally; keep them out of git.

How to run (quick reminder)
- Backend: cd backend && npm install && npm run dev (port 3000).
- Frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev (port 5173).

Next steps for Kat
- Skim FILE_EXPLANATIONS.txt to see the current structure and all generated/lock files now documented.
- Decide on the two deleted docs (keep or remove) and push once resolved.
- If you rebuild frontend or regenerate Prisma, note any new artifacts and update FILE_EXPLANATIONS.txt to stay in sync.
